# My Python Learning Journey 🚀

Hi! I'm Berke. This repository hosts the projects I build to improve my Python skills.

I believe in **"learning by doing"**. Instead of just watching tutorials, I focus on building real-world applications, games, and automation scripts to master new concepts.

## 📂 What's Inside?

I regularly update this repository with new projects covering:

- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming):** Designing modular and scalable code (e.g., Gladiator Game).
- **Algorithms & Logic:** Solving problems and building game mechanics.
- **Database Management:** Using SQL/SQLite for data persistence.
- **File Handling:** Managing data with JSON and Text files.

## 🎯 Goal

My goal is to continuously improve my coding skills, learn new technologies, and build a solid portfolio.
